# SimpleBank

This application is intended to be a very simple bank. 

It wil have the following functionalities:
	- create an account with Name, accountNum, limit
	- deposit X amount of money (can't go over limit or ignored)
	- withdraw x amount of money

The following assumptions are made:
	- the deposit/withdraw values are all whole numbers
	- initial balance starts at 0
	- Name is unique, no two users will have the same name 



- An overview of your design decisions:
	- I've decided to go with a simple hashmap for the different bank accounts.
- Why you picked the programming language you used
	- Java is the language that I'm most comfortable with so I decided to stick with something I knew well. 
- How to run your code and tests, including how to compile it if applicable and
  how to install any dependencies your code may have.
 To run the program:
	1. Configure the java applet using the main file and input as many arguments as necessary
	2. Click the run button to run the program.
	3. Same configuration for the tests, except choose JUnit instead
